# Tracing Prostate-Specific Antigen-producing Cells with Visium Spatial Gene Expression

## Introduction

The introduction of spatial transcriptomics technologies has marked a significant leap forward in our ability to dissect the complex molecular landscapes of biological tissues. These cutting-edge approaches merge the detailed spatial information of histological analysis with the comprehensive expression profiles obtained through transcriptomics, offering an unprecedented view of how genes are expressed across different regions of tissue. My fascination lies squarely with these innovative technologiesâ€”their mechanisms, capabilities, and the transformative impact they promise for biological research.

Visium Spatial Gene Expression, developed by 10X Genomics, is one of the most widely used spatial transcriptomics technologies.  The technology utilizes uniquely designed slides with thousands of oligo-dT capture spots that correspond to known coordinates. When a tissue section is placed onto these slides and permeabilized, mRNA from the tissue binds to these spots, enabling the subsequent sequencing of these transcripts. Each spot thus becomes a data point, not just for the expression of thousands of genes, but also for their precise location within the tissue. The output of a Visium experiment is a rich dataset that includes both a high-resolution image of the stained tissue section and a comprehensive gene expression profile for each spot, effectively providing a detailed gene expression map of the entire tissue section. It is important to note that each spot is multiple times bigger than an average cell, and thus Visium does not provide a single-cell resolution. 

This dual output bridges a crucial gap in biomedical research. For the first time, we can see not only the landscape of gene expression across a tissue but also the exact spatial context of this expression. This means that for diseases like cancer, where the localization and microenvironment could significantly influence disease progression and treatment response, Visium offers insights of unprecedented detail and relevance. 

In the spotlight of my current exploration is the application of Visium Spatial Gene Expression to study the distribution of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) producing cells within the prostate gland. The prostate gland emerges as a critical player within the male reproductive system. Among its various functions, the production of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA), also known as kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3), is of paramount interest to researchers and clinicians alike. PSA, a serine protease, not only plays a critical role in semen liquefaction but also serves as a key biomarker for prostate health, particularly in the diagnosis and monitoring of prostate cancer. 

Visium's output allows us to pinpoint the regions within the tissue where PSA expression is most active, providing a spatial dimension to our understanding of gene expression that was previously out of reach. This deep dive into the spatial transcriptomics of the prostate gland opens new avenues for understanding tissue architecture and function, offering a glimpse into the future of molecular biology and disease diagnostics. In this paper, I present a comprehensive walkthrough of the Visium data analysis and results. 

## Methods

### Dataset

I used a publicly available spatial gene expression dataset of normal human prostate tissue. This dataset, generously provided by 10x Genomics, leverages their pioneering Visium Spatial Gene Expression technology. The sample, sourced from FFPE (Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded) human prostate tissue, was obtained through Indivumed Human Tissue Specimens.

### Data Analysis

After acquiring the dataset, I turned to Scanpy, a Python-based library designed for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data, which has been adeptly adapted for Visium Spatial Gene Expression datasets. Scanpy's comprehensive toolkit allowed for the efficient preprocessing, analysis, and visualization of the spatial transcriptomics data.

**Preprocessing**

To load Visium data into Scanpy, I used the `scanpy.read_visium` function, which converts the data into an Anndata object, which contains counts, images, and spatial coordinates. 

I then calculate the quality control metrics, such as the number of counts, the number of genes by count, and the percentage of mitochondrial genes. I applied filters to exclude spots with an unusually high or low number of detected genes and UMIs as well as unusually high mitochondrial genes. Quality control is crucial to ensure that data used for downstream analysis is free from technical artifacts and biological outliers.

I performed normalization to level the playing field across spots by adjusting for differences in sequencing depth. I employed logarithmic transformation to stabilize variance across the dataset. I then conducted data scaling, which centered the gene expression data and reduced the influence of genes with extreme expression levels, allowing for more equitable comparisons across genes.

**Processing**

The preprocessed data is then subject to feature engineering, where highly variable genes are identified. These genes are often the most informative and are therefore selected for dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA serves to reduce the complexity of the data, distilling it into its most informative components and making it more amenable for the next steps of analysis.

Upon dimensionality reduction, a neighborhood graph of spots is constructed based on their PCA-reduced expression profiles. This graph forms the basis for subsequent clustering, which groups spots based on their expression similarities, unveiling the underlying heterogeneity within the dataset. The graph's structure is further refined using algorithms such as Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for visualization.

**Clustering and Annotation**

To identify distinct expression patterns within the prostate tissue, we performed clustering using the Leiden algorithm implemented in Scanpy. This approach grouped spots based on similarity in gene expression, hinting at potential functional zones within the tissue. It is important to note that these spots are bigger than cells, and thus may contain more than one cell type. Each cluster was then annotated based on known markers or differential expression analysis, aiming to identify regions of interest, such as those rich in PSA-producing cells.

**Visualizing Spatial Patterns**

Leveraging Scanpy's spatial plotting functions, I visualized the distribution of clusters and PSA expression across the tissue section. The `scanpy.pl.spatial` function provided a direct way to overlay gene expression data onto high-resolution tissue images, illustrating the spatial organization of gene expression and highlighting areas with elevated PSA levels.

## Results

My investigation into the spatial gene expression within human prostate tissue yielded insightful results using Visium. 

**Cell Density and Gene Expression Heterogeneity**

Figure 1 presents two spatial distribution plots derived from Visium Spatial Transcriptomics data of human prostate tissue. Each dot represents a distinct spot on the Visium slide corresponding to a specific tissue area, overlaid on a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained section. 

On the left, the total counts plot illustrates the overall transcriptional activity at each spot. The color intensity indicates the total number of transcripts (or reads) detected, with warmer colors (yellow-green) denoting higher counts, suggesting regions with higher overall gene expression or cellular density.

On the right, the number of genes by counts plot shows the diversity of gene expression at each spot. The color scale reflects the number of unique genes detected at each spot, with warmer colors (yellow-green) highlighting spots with a higher diversity of gene expression.

Together, these plots provide insight into both the quantity and complexity of gene expression across different regions of the prostate tissue. They revealed a heterogeneous expression profile across the sampled tissue spots. Regions with high total counts and gene diversity might correspond to areas with a high density of cells or a high level of transcriptional activity, potentially indicating biologically active or significant zones within the tissue for further study. These regions, which are mostly around the ducts align with the known histology of the tissue as these regions are rich in secretary cells.

**Spatial Clustering of Gene Expression**

Further analysis delineated distinct spatial clusters within the tissue, as shown in the UMAP (Figure 2) and corresponding histological plots (Figure 3). The cluster plot represents the result of a Leiden clustering algorithm, identifying ten distinct clusters (labeled 0-9) based on gene expression patterns. When mapped back onto the tissue image, these clusters exhibit a clear spatial organization, suggesting that gene expression is not random but structured within the tissue architecture.

**Identification of PSA Production**

Focusing on Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA), or KLK3, expression, the analysis pinpointed regions within the prostate tissue characterized by higher expression levels of this critical biomarker. The UMAP and spatial plots provide a compelling illustration of KLK3 expression across the prostate tissue.

The UMAP plot (Figure 4) visualizes the differential expression of KLK3 among the identified clusters, revealing that its expression is not evenly distributed but is concentrated in clusters 4 and 7. These clusters appear to be hotspots for KLK3 expression.

Moving to the spatial plot (Figure 5), I overlay this expression data onto the actual tissue architecture, where the expression levels of KLK3 are superimposed on an image of the tissue section. Here, we see the expression pattern of KLK3 correlating with the physical locations that likely represent the epithelial luminal cells around the ducts, which are the secretory powerhouses of the prostate. These cells are known to be the main producers of PSA, which is in line with the regions of elevated expression noted in the analysis.

**Considering Alternative Hypotheses**

In assessing the significance of regions with high KLK3 expression within the prostate tissue, I proposed an alternative hypothesis: the observed high expression of KLK3 might simply reflect areas of overall high transcriptional activity rather than specific zones of PSA production. To investigate this hypothesis, I conducted a comparative analysis focusing on the expression patterns of other cell-type-specific markers.

The expression of FBLN1, a marker gene for fibroblasts, was mapped across the prostate tissue sections. The resulting visualization, as shown in the accompanying figure, indicates that FBLN1 expression is predominantly localized in regions distinct from those showing high KLK3 expression. This suggests that the high expression of KLK3 is not a mere artifact of general transcriptional activity, as fibroblast-rich areas do not overlap with the KLK3 enrichment zones.

Furthermore, the expression of TPM2, a marker for smooth muscle cells, was also analyzed. The spatial expression pattern of TPM2 revealed enrichment in regions different from both the high KLK3 expression areas and the fibroblast-marked territories. This further supports the specificity of the KLK3 expression to certain cell types within the prostate tissue and refutes the hypothesis that KLK3 expression is solely a consequence of heightened global transcriptional activity.

Figure 7: Spatial Localization of TPM2 Expression in Prostate Tissue. This plot illustrates regions rich in smooth muscle cells, marked by TPM2 expression, separate from the high KLK3 expression zones.

These observations provide evidence against the hypothesis that the high expression levels of KLK3 are due to overall transcriptional upregulation within those tissue areas. Instead, the distinct spatial expression profiles of cell-type-specific markers underscore the presence of specialized niches within the prostate gland. Such niches harbor cell populations with unique transcriptional signatures related to their specific functions, such as PSA production by epithelial luminal cells, structural support by fibroblasts, and contractility provided by smooth muscle cells.

## Conclusion

The exploration of spatial gene expression within the prostate gland using Visium Spatial Gene Expression has demonstrated the remarkable specificity of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) production at the cellular level. By leveraging advanced transcriptomic technology and sophisticated analytical methods, this study has revealed distinct patterns of gene expression within normal human prostate tissue, highlighting areas with elevated PSA production that correspond to the locations of secretory epithelial cells.

The comparison of PSA expression with the distribution of other cell-type-specific markersâ€”FBLN1 for fibroblasts and TPM2 for smooth muscle cellsâ€”has provided further evidence to refute the hypothesis that the high expression of PSA is simply due to overall high transcriptional activity. Instead, the distinct spatial expression patterns for each marker strongly suggest the presence of specialized niches within the prostate tissue, each associated with unique cell types and functions. These findings are critical for understanding the functional architecture of the prostate gland and may have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate-related conditions.

This study showcases the power of spatial transcriptomics in uncovering the hidden complexities of tissue structure and gene expression. As I conclude, it is clear that technologies like Visium Spatial Gene Expression are invaluable tools for the biomedical research community, allowing us to trace the intricate details of cellular function within their native tissue environments. The continued development and application of such technologies will undoubtedly enhance our understanding of complex biological systems and pave the way for personalized and precise medical interventions.
